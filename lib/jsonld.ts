/**
 * Structured data for the site.
 *
 * ⚠ THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS FOR — JSON-LD is read one page at a time. An
 * `@id` declared elsewhere does not exist: a page that writes
 * `publisher: { '@id': '…/#org' }` without declaring the `#org` node in the
 * same document produces a dangling reference, which engines drop in silence.
 * The `#website` / `#org` / `#person` base is therefore REPEATED ON EVERY
 * PAGE — that is what `siteGraph()` is for. Never "factor it out" to one page.
 *
 * What this replaced: the home page carried an anonymous `SoftwareApplication`
 * plus an `FAQPage`, and the twelve landing pages carried an `FAQPage` and
 * nothing else. Nothing tied the pages of the site into a single entity, and
 * nothing told an engine that the thing being described on /cr2-viewer is the
 * same application as the one on /nef-viewer.
 *
 * `@id` NAMING CONVENTION:
 *   · global entities → fragment on the root     `/#website`, `/#org`, `/#person`
 *   · per-page nodes  → fragment on the page URL `/cr2-viewer/#page`
